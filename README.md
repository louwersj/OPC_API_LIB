# OPC_API_LIB
Open Oracle Public Cloud API library to provide standard functions to be used when scripting againt the API from the Oracle Public Cloud. The prime development language for the API library is bash. In future release an addition and/or integration of additional languages might be added. All code has been developed and tested on Oracle Linux and tested against the latest version of the Oracle Public Cloud API as it is available to the public. 

## Documentation
All documentation on the main release will be maintained under the documentation section in a markdown format.

## Other tooling
what about other tooling? What about, for example, the official PaaS Service Manager Command Line Interface? We feel very strongly that tools like the Oracle PaaS Service Manager Command Line Interface is a very good solution and could very well be used to achieve some (most) of the same functionality. Addittionally, the Oracle PaaS Service Manager Command Line Interface has a strong focus on PaaS while the Open Oracle Public Cloud API library will have a strong focus on IaaS. However, we also feel that it might be missing a level of comfort to use to some developers who code their own integration in a wider integration flow. To provide this higher level of comfort and ease of use for developers in the form of a API library we intend to bdrige this gap. Having stated this, the Oracle PaaS Service Manager Command Line Interface and other Oracle tooling is a very valuable tool which can be used in many cases where you also might be able to use the Open Oracle Public Cloud API library. More information on [Oracle PaaS Service Manager Command Line Interface](http://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/java-cloud/pscli/paas-service-manager-command-line-interface-reference.pdf) can be found on the Oracle documentation website.
